# Blender-Texture-Manager
This project intends to serve as a PBR texture manager for Blender, to simplify the process of downloading & offloading textures in order to preserve storage space. The initial version will let the user search through a list of PBR textures, and once they select their desired texture, it will download in the selected resolution to a set folder. Users will also be able to remove their textures through this application.

## Future Plans
In the future, this project will be able to be initialized in the directory that a Blender project exists within, where the list required textures can be stored. The textures will all still be physically stored in a separate location, but users can then install / delete the textures needed for an entire project from one place, drastically cutting down on the storage required.
