# Blender-Texture-Manager
This project intends to serve as a PBR texture manager for Blender, to simplify the process of downloading & offloading textures in order to preserve storage space. The initial version will let the user search through a list of PBR textures, and once they select their desired texture, it will download in the selected resolution to a set folder.
